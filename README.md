# DigitRecogniser
A very, very basic digit recogniser and gaussian calculators functions with basic Python

## Run the programme
To run the basic digit recogniser:
``python run_digit_recogniser.py``

Mixture components are 0 by default (just single multivariate gaussian for each state). To increase them:
``python run_digit_recogniser.py -mix {number of mixture components}``

Training and test data and a more detailed explanation will be added shortly.
For now, the digit recogniser can be run by adding training data to the Train folder and test data to the Test folder.
